## Usage

Each file in this repository contains a standalone implementation of an algorithm or data structure, with example usage provided in the comments. You can include these files directly in your contest submissions or use them as a reference to implement your own versions.

## How to Contribute

Contributions are welcome! If you have an optimized version of an existing algorithm or a new algorithm that you think should be included, feel free to open a pull request. Please ensure your code is well-documented and includes example usage.
